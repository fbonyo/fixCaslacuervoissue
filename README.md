✅ The Fix: Resolution Summary
The root cause was determined to be a conflicting or corrupted local network configuration specific to the Series S's Alternate Port Selection. While the console's general connection tests passed, the required peer-to-peer connection used by EA Sports' servers for Division Rivals was failing due to a mismatch in NAT settings or a blocked default port.

The Solution Applied:
Manual Network Reset: Performing a full console and router restart.

Clearing MAC Address: A deeper network setting reset on the Xbox.

Crucially: Navigating to Advanced Network Settings on the Xbox and manually setting the Alternate Port Selection from automatic to a fixed, open UDP port (e.g., a port within the range of 3074 to 3099, if available and not blocked by the user's ISP/router). This forced the console to use a clean, uncontested path for the game's P2P traffic.

Result: The user casla_cuervo can now connect to and complete Division Rivals matches consistently without encountering the previous connection error.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Fix Guide for Others
If you are experiencing a similar issue on your Xbox Series S or Series X, follow these steps to reset and optimize your network configuration for EA Sports FC:
Phase 1: Standard Reset & System Check
Power Cycle the Network: Turn off your Xbox, modem, and router. Wait two full minutes, then turn the modem and router back on. Wait until they are fully operational (all lights stable) before turning the Xbox back on.

Clear Local MAC Address:

Go to Settings > General > Network Settings.

Select Advanced Settings.

Select Alternate MAC Address.

Select Clear. (The console will prompt you to restart).

Check NAT Type: After the restart, go back to Network Settings. Your NAT Type should ideally be Open or Moderate. If it is Strict, you likely have a deeper router firewall issue.

Phase 2: Advanced Port Configuration (The Key Fix)
WARNING: Only proceed with this if Phase 1 did not solve your issue. This step forces a specific networking path.

Go to Settings > General > Network Settings.

Select Advanced Settings.

Select Alternate Port Selection.

Change the setting from Automatic to Manual.

Select one of the pre-defined port numbers (a UDP port, usually displayed in the 3000 or 5000 ranges).

Recommendation: Try a port that is not the default 3074. Try Port 50000 or Port 3097 first, then test a match.

Phase 3: Router Check (If needed)
If the problem persists, your router may be blocking essential ports for EA Sports FC's connection. You may need to enable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router or manually forward the following UDP ports to your Xbox's IP address:

UDP: 3659, 9000 - 9999

UDP: The port you manually selected in Phase 2 (e.g., 3097 or 50000).

📚 Further Information
This particular issue highlights that while an Xbox console may pass the basic "Test network connection" and "Test multiplayer connection," the peer-to-peer mechanism used by specific game modes (like Division Rivals) requires a more robust and unambiguous network path than the standard console settings sometimes provide. The Alternate Port Selection feature is a powerful tool to force the console's traffic onto a clean path, bypassing any temporary corruption or routing confusion in the network stack.
